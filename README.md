This project is a work-in-progress effort aimed at developing and training a reinforcement learning agent to play the game of Minesweeper using Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The goal is to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of reinforcement learning in navigating and solving the complexities of Minesweeper, a classic puzzle game.
